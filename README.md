# Diogenes' Library
A simple Django website for keeping track of your books. Registration closed for now, but guests can log in with u/p guest/guest and give it a whirl. Clicking on the Collection tab will show a few books I have added for demonstration purposes.

The collection page is sortable thanks to tablesorter (www.tablesorter.com).

Books have six fields: Title, Author, Year published, Publisher, ISBN, Genre

Users can add books to their collections, edit added books, and delete them from their collections.

Planned additions in the future include: Being able to show/hide fields in the collection table, sharing your collection, and multi-page collection.
